# Sending Mail with PHP and JavaScript Handler

##  Description:

This project demonstrates a simple web application for sending emails using PHP and a JavaScript handler. The application uses SMTP mail services such as Gmail for sending emails. Users can input their Gmail username, password, SMTP port, and recipient's email address in the form/send.php file to send emails.

## Features:

1. Email Sending: Users can fill in the required details, including their Gmail username and password, SMTP port, and recipient's email address, to send emails.

2. Validation: The application provides real-time validation of input fields using JavaScript. It checks for required fields, valid email format, and input length to   ensure accurate data submission.

3. Error Handling: If there are any errors in the input data, appropriate error messages will be displayed to guide the user in correcting the information before submission.

4. Styling: The user interface is styled with CSS to provide a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience.
Instructions:

##  Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the form/send.php file and fill in your Gmail username, password, SMTP port, and recipient's email address.
Ensure you have a PHP server set up to run the application locally. You can use XAMPP, WAMP, or any other PHP server of your choice.
Start the PHP server and navigate to the project's root folder in your browser.
Fill in the required fields in the form, and the application will handle the email sending process.
